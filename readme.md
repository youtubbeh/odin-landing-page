This is a solution to the [The Odin Landing Page Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

### Links

- [Github repo to review code](https://github.com/youtubbeh/odin-landing-page)
- [Live site](https://regal-liger-7ab74f.netlify.app/)

## My process

1. Looking at the desired outcome and drawing on paper which elements would be divs and sections, and which of these would have flexbox properties, as well as what flex-direction they would have. 
2. Building the structure and content completely on HTML.
3. Adding all styles on CSS sheet except flexbox, working section by section, top-down.
4. Adding flexbox properties, again, section by section, top-down.
5. Correcting and fine-tuning everything 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
